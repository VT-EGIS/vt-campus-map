TODO List
=========

1. The user should be able to bookmark locations through their browser.
  For this we need to update the url with some identifier after
  a location has been identified and displayed on the screen. We will also 
  need to parse the query parameters at the beginning to see if it has the
  identifier.
2. Integrate the application with a website tour plugin like
  [bootstrap tours](http://bootstraptour.com/) to educate users about
  the many helpful features provided by the VT Interactive Map.
3. Increase test coverage.
4. Make the font size consistent across the website.
5. Remove the modal based category navigation.
6. Finalize the architecture and deployment procedure.
7. Replace categories by a 'search' navigation link. This will have 2 elements.

    * Search by name
    * Search by category

  Both will open modals. The search by category modal will still work the same.
  The search by name modal will be auto-complete based.
  We can keep the search bar on the map for redundancy purposes.
8. About should be a simple link instead of being part of the navigation.
9. Make Legend, Map Type and Layers non-scrollable.
10. Add documentation
