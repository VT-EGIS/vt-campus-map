TODO List
=========

1. The user should be able to bookmark locations through their browser.
  For this we need to update the url with some identifier after
  a location has been identified and displayed on the screen. We will also 
  need to parse the query parameters at the beginning to see if it has the
  identifier.
2. Integrate the application with a website tour plugin like
  [bootstrap tours](http://bootstraptour.com/) to educate users about
  the many helpful features provided by the VT Interactive Map.
  This will be under the 'help' navigation dropdown along with the 'about'
  link.
3. Add lavery hall in the buildings layer and CRC in the category list.
4. Add roads in the gazeteer layer.
5. Add documentation.
