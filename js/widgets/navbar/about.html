    This interactive map is based on data and images provided by several groups within the university.
    The map is subject to continual change as the university grows,
    new features are added, and outdated information is purged from the databases that supply map information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Navigation features of this map (category search, featured places,
    etc.) are currently only accurate to the building level.
    The position of the "pointer" or other indicator graphics should
    not be interpreted to identify the specific room in which a point of interest is located.
  </p>
  <p>
    The "Find my Location" feature (the circle icon on the left side, under the plus and minus zoom buttons)
    relies on your browser's geolocation service
    (<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/geolocation/" target="_blank">what's this?</a>)
    to arrive at a best guess of where you are.
    The accuracy of this estimate may vary dramatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    Access routes may be blocked by construction or maintenance work
    &mdash; users can check the VT Facilities Department's
